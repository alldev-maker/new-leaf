## Infrastructure

Any time there is a push to `main`, it will automatically deploy to the production site.

## Workflow

When working on an issue please work on a new branch that is forked from `main`. Naming convnetions for branches are `<issue number>_<issue summary>`. For example, if you are working on issue "#6 Insert favicon" then please name your branch `6_favicon` or something similar.

When writing commit messages, reference the issue number you are working on with `#<issue number>`. Commit messages should look like `<commit message> #<issue number>`. So if you are working on "#6 Insert favicon" then your commit message would look something like this: "Add favicon to page head #6". This means that all commits can be viewed on the relevant issue ticket. 

Once you have finished work on a branch then please created a pull request and it will be merged into `main` and deployed.
